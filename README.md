# Personal-Website

This project was created in order to hone and experiment my HTML, CSS, and Javascript abilities while also having fun and displaying my personality. The layout of the site relied on the use of bootstrap, allowing for responsive elements on all device widths. CSS was used for styling, obviously, and Javascript was used in order to create dyanmic height alignment (since it appears to be difficult to achieve vertical alignment without losing responsiveness), form validation, and other effects. Lastly, the logo was also custom made.
